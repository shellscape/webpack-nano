# webpack-nano [![tests][tests]][tests-url] [![cover][cover]][cover-url] [![size][size]][size-url]

A teensy, squeaky üê§ clean Webpack CLI

`webpack-nano` operates on the premise that all options for configuring a webpack build are set via a [config file](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/).

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install webpack-nano --save-dev
```

## Requirements

`webpack-nano` is an evergreen module. üå≤ This module requires Node v10.11.0+.

## Benefits

- Holy bananas üçå it's itsy bitsy
- Doesn't hit you over the head with an avalanche of flags and options
- Allows any number of user-defined flags
- It does one thing: tells webpack to start a build
- ~90% smaller than webpack-cli and webpack-command

## Usage

```console
$ npx wp --help

  Usage
    $ wp [...options]

  Options
    --config          A path to a webpack config file
    --config.{name}   A path to a webpack config file, and the config name to run
    --help            Displays this message
    --silent          Instruct the CLI to produce no console output
    --version         Displays webpack-nano and webpack versions

  Examples
    $ wp
    $ wp --help
    $ wp --config webpack.config.js
    $ wp --config.serve webpack.config.js
```

## Custom Flags

With `webpack-cli` users are limited as to the flags they can use on with the `$ webpack` binary, and are instructed to use the `--env` flag for custom data. Well that's just üçåüçå. With `webpack-nano` users can specify an unlimited number of custom flags, _without restriction_.

Say you have a bundle which can be built to use different asset locations from cloud data sources, like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. And in this scenario you prefer to specify that location using a command-line flag. If you were using `webpack-cli`, you'd have to use the `--env.source` flag (or you'd get a big 'ol error) and use a function for your `webpack.config.js` export. Using `webpack-nano`:

```console
$ wp --config webpack.config.js --source s3
```

```js
// webpack.config.js
const argv = require('webpack-nano/argv');

const { source } = argv;

module.exports = {
  ...
}
```

‚ú® Magic. The `webpack-nano/argv` export provides quick and easy access to parsed command-line arguments, allowing the user to define the CLI experience as they want to.
